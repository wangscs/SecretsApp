# Secrets App
The purpose of this secrets app is to allow users to anonymously post content for other anonymous users to see. 
People who are not users (i.e did not create an account) are not allowed to view the secrets/posts.

My reason to make this is purely to practice user authentication and the different levels of security I am able to give a web app that I create.


# Notes for user Security/Encryption
### Level 1 Username and Password
- Basic if else checks whether user's information matches records in db
- Bad because password is stored as plain text in db

### Level 2 Encryption
- Use encryption to scramble strings
- Easy encryptions: Caesar Cipher, Enigma Machine
- Method used: AES-256-CBC encryption
- Encryption isnt good enough when my code base is store on an open source platform like github

### Level 3


### Level 4


### Level 5


### Level 6
